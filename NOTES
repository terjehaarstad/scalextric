All information found in these notes are all about Scalextric Advanced Power 
Base (C7042). Connection schematics might differ from other models.

The communication model is based on the serial communication standard, Universal
Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART), using half duplex transmission.
The protocol is suitable for general application under standard communication such as EIA RS-
485-Standard, RF-wireless and Infrared.

The UART configurations
-----------
1 start bit (0),
8 data bits,
1 stop bit (1),
No parity bit
Baudrate: 19,200b


RJ11 connector
-----------
Pin1 - Not connected
Pin2 - Ground
Pin3 - RS-485 â€“V(Receive/Transmit inverting)
Pin4 - RS-485 +V(Receive/Transmit not inverting)
Pin5 - 12 Volts
Pin6 - Not connected

Had to open up the display to get more information about the RS485 communication, 
found a chip connected to aux-port (75176B, rs485 transceiver). I found the FTDI
USB to RS485 converter to support this transceiver.

FTDI USB-RS485 Converter
-----------

1 - Black - GND
2 - Yellow - Data- (B)
3 - Red - Power
4 - Brown - Terminator 120R, Pin1
5 - Orange - Data+ (A)
6 - Green - Terminator 120R, Pin 2


APB to PC connection (Cat5 RJ11 Cable - FTDI USB RS485 Converter)
-----------
I used an Cat5 cable and terminated an RJ11 connector to one end.

1. Green - NC
2. Wh/Green - 1. Black
3. Blue  -  2. Yellow
4. Wh/Blue - 5. Orange
5. Brown - Do not connect! In fact, remove this wire from the connector.
6. Wh/Brown - NC

See "./docs/Connection.png" for schematic.
