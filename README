Ruby API which helps communicating with Scalextric Advanced Power Base and
control cars. It is not ment to be another RMS for Scalextric systems as
this code is developed with another project in mind. It is acting as a
very simple and cheap client to the APB with just a few functions implemented.

Features:
- Start and stop communication with APB.
- Populate packet received from APB.
- Enable/Disable LEDs on APB.
- Speed up and brake cars.

Example:
base = APB.new
base.start_comms
base.start_race
base.run_car(1,63)  # 63 == skidmarks.


Requirements:
- Ruby 2.2
- SerialPort-gem, specified in Gemspec-file.
